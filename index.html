                                        3 days later, Cola asked Ben out to dinner. He took her out for Falafel. They bond over their similar love of music, and the shared yearning to someday see Bonobo live in concert.

                            <p>They had always dreamed of getting a dog together, and planned to adopt that spring.

Ben & Cola already loved this puppy, so a few weeks later, added the newest addition to their adventuring family. They named her Chihiro after one of their favorite movie characters.</p>
